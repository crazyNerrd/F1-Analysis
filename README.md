Season Statistics Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing season statistics data for a sports league. The data includes information about players, teams, matches, and various performance metrics recorded throughout the season.

Overview
The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading: The provided CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame using Python.
Data Cleaning: Missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers are handled to ensure the integrity of the data.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics are computed to understand the central tendency and dispersion of numerical variables.
Data Visualization: Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are created to explore the distribution and relationships between variables.
Correlation Analysis: The correlation between numerical variables is examined to identify potential patterns or relationships.
Grouping and Aggregation: Data is grouped based on certain criteria, and aggregate statistics are computed to gain insights at different levels of granularity.
Usage
To run the analysis:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
